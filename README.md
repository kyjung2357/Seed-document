## File description
- [Seed document](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/tree/main/Seed%20document): This folder contains basic files to start document work. To compile Seed document.tex successfully, you need to install the 'bookmark' and 'enumitem' packages. We refer to Step 9 and Step 10 in Section 1.1 for more information.
- [Check document.tex](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/Check%20document.tex): If this file is compiled well, the installation is complete. (Compiling is learned in Section 2.1.)
- [keybindings.json](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/keybindings.json): This is the shortcut configuration file covered in Section 2.1.1.
- [latex.json](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/latex.json): Basic User Snippets. (User Snippets are learned in Section 2.1.5.)
