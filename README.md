# A 30-Year Journey: The Duration of Using LaTeX

In mathematics research, the usage of LaTeX is inevitable, making it an
essential tool for mathematicians throughout their careers. This seminar introduces
Visual Studio Code, a powerful editor that has gained significant
attention recently for its versatility and adaptability. The session will guide
you on how to utilize LaTeX within Visual Studio Code. The seminar also offers
a tutorial of Git, a handy tool for version control and team-based projects,
thereby promoting efficient workflows and collaboration with peers. Lastly, the
seminar shares four powerful tools – GitHub Copilot, JabRef, Mathpix, and
ChatGPT – each carefully selected to streamline your work processes.

## File description
- [Seed document](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/tree/main/Seed%20document): This folder contains basic files to start document work. To compile Seed document.tex successfully, you need to install the 'bookmark' and 'enumitem' packages. We refer to Step 9 and Step 10 in Section 1.1 for more information.
- [Check document.tex](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/Check%20document.tex): If this file is compiled well, the installation is complete. (Compiling is learned in Section 2.1.)
- [keybindings.json](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/keybindings.json): This is the shortcut configuration file covered in Section 2.1.1.
- [latex.json](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/latex.json): Basic User Snippets. (User Snippets are learned in Section 2.1.5.)
- [settings.json](https://github.com/kyjung2357/Seed-document/blob/main/settings.json): This is the configuration file covered in Section 2.1.1.
